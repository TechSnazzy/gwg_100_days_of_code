# Grow With Google 100 Days of Code Journal Entries, 2018


### Day 1 - June 27th (Wednesday)
First I headed over to the Classic Arcade Game Clone Project Details page and read over the "How do I complete this project" page. Cloned the game repo and then pushed it up to my GitHub site.

After that I started to look at the gameplay from the video and go over the `app.js` file to get familiar with it. Then I went over the project rubric.

Next I started reading the Project Instructions and tried to start thinking about what I might need to do to accomplish each part. For example, thinking about what classes I might need to implement (which I do not know the answer yet ðŸ˜ƒ ).

Realizing as I read this that I need to learn more about HTML5 Canvas information. Not quite familiar with that yet but I hope I will learn it as I go here.

For today I spent time getting my Arcade Game project setup on GitHub. So I cloned the project, setup my own repo, etc. Then I spent some time becoming familiar with the game requirements and instructions (thereâ€™s a lot) and getting ready to start writing code. Tomorrow I will spend trying to write some pseudocode and see if I can spark some progress.


### Day 2 - June 28th (Thursday)
So this is really really really difficult. Here's what happens: I go through the lessons and I understand everything I'm doing as I'm doing it. I write things on paper, work it all out and it seems to make sense. But then when I get to a project like this, it's as if I haven't learned anything. Ok, so anyway this concludes my complaining.

What I learned is that I have a game board, some enemies and a player. The player moves vertically and horizontally, one square at a time. Each enemy moves horizontally at various speeds.

So today Iâ€™m living in Chrome, in Dev Tools, working on Project 3. I have spent the past 30 minutes trying to fix the errors in so I could get the game board to show up. That seems to be the general consensus of how to start as far as Iâ€™ve seen people say on Slack. Anyway, so far no success. But I will keep trying.

EDIT: I went ahead and started taking the free HTML5 Canvas Basics course to see if that would help spark something. And it did. Now I understand how to use the X and Y coordinates and I managed to load an image on the page using some JS and Canvas. Might not seem like much but I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.

### Day 3 - June 29th (Friday)
Today I spent some time helping one of my fellow scholars figure out how to use Git in Windows. Personally I had never used it in Windows before so I had to figure it out. I installed Git for Windows and then showed her how to open Git Bash and told her to edit her .bash_profile.sh file using either VI or VIM editor. That seems to have done the trick. Now I learned something new. I normally just use Git from within the Mac terminal.

### Day 4 - June 30th (Saturday)
So today I am continuing on with then HTML5 Canvas Basics course. Working on building this meme generator so Iâ€™ll need a web server for this. I already have a LAMP server running in a VirtualBox VM. But now Iâ€™m building a MAMP server according to the instructions in the course.

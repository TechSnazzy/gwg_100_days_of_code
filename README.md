# Grow With Google 100 Days of Code Journal Entries, 2018

### Day 1 - June 27th (Wednesday)
First I headed over to the Classic Arcade Game Clone Project Details page and read over the "How do I complete this project" page. Cloned the game repo and then pushed it up to my GitHub site.

After that I started to look at the gameplay from the video and go over the `app.js` file to get familiar with it. Then I went over the project rubric.

Next I started reading the Project Instructions and tried to start thinking about what I might need to do to accomplish each part. For example, thinking about what classes I might need to implement (which I do not know the answer yet ðŸ˜ƒ ).

Realizing as I read this that I need to learn more about HTML5 Canvas information. Not quite familiar with that yet but I hope I will learn it as I go here.

For today I spent time getting my Arcade Game project setup on GitHub. So I cloned the project, setup my own repo, etc. Then I spent some time becoming familiar with the game requirements and instructions (thereâ€™s a lot) and getting ready to start writing code. Tomorrow I will spend trying to write some pseudocode and see if I can spark some progress.
